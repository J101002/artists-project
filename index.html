        <h2>Why BTS?</h2>
        <h3>BTS, a sensational icon</h3>
        <p>BTS members were first discovered in 2010 by their current management company Big Hit Entertainment, a South Korean entertainment company.</p>
        <p>After being discovered, the new recruits become trainees who received coaching to prepare them to be superstars. This includes dancing and singing lessons as well as acting and media training.</p>
        <p>"Think of it like college," Bang Si-Hyuk, the founder and Co-CEO of Big Hit, said in the HBS case study.</p>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Jennifer Salto and I've been a fan of BTS since 2017.
            These seven people have become inspirational idols in my eyes, and I
            would love for their music to expand to different people. I created
            this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my
            coding skills, but also for people to get to know BTS.
          </p>
