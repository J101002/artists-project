        <h2>Why BTS?</h2>
        <h3>BTS, a sensational icon</h3>
        <p>BTS members were first discovered in 2010 by their current management company Big Hit Entertainment, a South Korean entertainment company.</p>
        <p>After being discovered, the new recruits become trainees who received coaching to prepare them to be superstars. This includes dancing and singing lessons as well as acting and media training.</p>
        <p>"Think of it like college," Bang Si-Hyuk, the founder and Co-CEO of Big Hit, said in the HBS case study.</p>

                <p>
                    “봄날 (Spring Day)” is the title track of BTS's sophomore repackage album, You Never Walk Alone. 
                    The song's lyrics give a positive light over a friend's absence, utilizing a seasonal metaphor 
                    to deliberate on how things will get better afterward.

                    둘! 셋! (그래도 좋은 날이 더 많기를) [2! 3! (Still Wishing For More Good Days)] is based on a fan song from BTS to ARMY (fandom name). 
                    It talks about how everything will get better, but not without some hardships along the way too. They are telling ARMYs to forget about their 
                    worries, struggles, and sadness and to count to three and be free from it.

                <p>
                    "Persona" is the intro song for BTS's album MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA. Sung by BTS' rapper 
                    and leader, RM, it is a self-reflective song that challenges the concepts of personality 
                    and character.

          <p>
            Hi! My name is Jennifer Salto and I've been a fan of BTS since 2017.
            These seven people have become inspirational idols in my eyes, and I
            would love for their music to expand to different people. I created
            this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop my
            coding skills, but also for people to get to know BTS.
